*What does it mean to "do" electronics?*

## The Plushie Monster

The first lab you'll do in {{site.short}} is the "plushie monster." This brings together **physical craft** (sewing) and electronics (a microcontroller and LEDs).


## Process

In this course, we'll typically break things into steps...

### Read and Reflect

You've been given a copy of [Plush Monsters: Creatures with Character]({{site.media}}/monsters.pdf) {{site.pdf}}. Read it over.

### Brainstorm and Discuss

Then, grab a monster template, and with a partner, talk through some ideas. Things to consider:

* Do you think it is OK for the line from the + side of the battery to cross over the line that goes back to the - side of the battery?
* There is a power switch on the battery... where are you going to put that, so you can get to it?
* What will make your plushie distinctive? Plan it out on paper before you dive in with needle and thread.

### Make and Explore

Grab a template, your plans, and begin exploring. We try not to waste materials in {{site.short}}, so don't go completely nuts and throw things out that have useful value left in them. (Scrap felt, for example, shouldn't be thrown out unless it really is tiny and "scrap.")

## TTFN

That's "Ta Ta For Now," if you were wondering. We'll be doing more with this lab over the course of the next week, but that's enough to get us started.
