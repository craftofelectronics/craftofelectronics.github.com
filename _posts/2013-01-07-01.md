## Monday, Jan 7

### Before Class

* Purchase the course text [Make: Electronics](http://www.amazon.com/Make-Electronics-Discovery-Charles-Platt/dp/0596153740). You can get this at the bookstore.
* Install [Dropbox](http://db.tt/zgUQOl6A). It is free, and using it is required for this course. Watch [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52xllJksWg4) for an explanation of what it is and why you need it.
* You need safety goggles. If you don't have them, I will do a bulk order for everyone who does not yet.
* You need a way to keep your work organized; a notebook is a good start.
