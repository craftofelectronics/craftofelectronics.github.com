# First Exam Contents

You can expect a mixture of true/false, multiple choice, and short answer questions. As part of any of these, you may need to recall knowledge from the readings, work a problem, or inspect a diagram, schematic, or other visual representation of a circuit or electrical system.

I aspire to exams that are fair and unsurprising. This does not mean they are easy; I personally hope they are challenging and stretch you as a learner.

## Readings

We have had an assortment of readings throughout the term. You might go through the calendar, week-by-week, and identify those readings. You will be responsible for the content in them.

## Home and Class Work

We engaged in several activities in-class and as homework to explore electricity and electronics. For example, the home electric code research project had you read, summarize, and come together as a group to present your best understanding of home wiring code to each-other. You should probably review the materials we produced (in a Wiki in Moodle) before the exam.

## Theory

We have been building our understanding of theory in electronics; you are responsible for understanding resistors, LEDs, series and parallel circuits, and how to do calculations on them. (This list is not comprehensive, but it is representative of the places we have focused to some degree.)

## Labs

We have been slowed in our lab work by technology. That said, revisit your work on the plushie monster and the oscilloscope. I am well aware of what we have and have not been able to do.
