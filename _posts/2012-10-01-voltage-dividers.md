# Voltage Dividers

These pencasts explore the mathematics we did in class on Friday. I work three problems, step-by-step, so you can follow along. 

* [Voltage Dividers 1]({{site.url}}/downloads/20120929-voltage-dividers-01-pencast.pdf)
* [Voltage Dividers 2]({{site.url}}/downloads/20120929-voltage-dividers-02-pencast.pdf)
* [Voltage Dividers 3]({{site.url}}/downloads/20120929-voltage-dividers-03-pencast.pdf)

Remember, you need to download these and use Acrobat to view them.

#### How To Use The Pencasts

**Just watching will not help you learn.** If this material confuses you, you need to actually put pen to paper and do the problems along with me. 

After you're done with these problems, download the [Voltage Dividers!](http://goo.gl/C0aoo) app. This Windows program will let you practice problems involving voltage dividers. It assumes two resistors (R1 and R2), and asks you to report the voltage drop that would take place across of each of those resistors. At any point, you can click the **Brag to Matt** button and report your score to me. 

My ask: aspire to getting 15 or 20 right. You should be able to do these without difficulty. At that point, you will be ready for the next step.

I am available for office hours, and you might also consider coming in to work with a TA during the open lab times (7:30PM - 9:00PM, Sunday through Thursday).

(If the link above didn't work for downloading the app, try [this one](http://jadud.com/people/mcj/files/voltage-dividers.zip).)
