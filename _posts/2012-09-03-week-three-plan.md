# Week Three Plan

The [plan for week three]({{site.url}}/cal/w02.html) has been posted. We will be building our Freeduinos, as well as beginning design and planning work for our [Contrast Houses]({{site.url}}/bereacontrasthouse/index.html).

# Site Updates

It is worth noting that there are now sections in the menu for "Assignments" and "Resources." The assignments page lists all of the assignments we do (in class or as homework), which may make it easier for you to find things.
