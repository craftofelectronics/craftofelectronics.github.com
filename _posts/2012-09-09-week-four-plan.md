# Week Four Plan

The [plan for week four]({{site.url}}/cal/w03.html) has been posted. This week, we'll finish our Freeduinos, test them with some software, and also start learning our first fundamental tool of electronics: the oscilloscope.

## Turning In Work: A Note

For all future assignments, please always name your files:

In the last round of reports, we received anything and everything in terms of filenames. Admittedly, I didn't explicitly ask for a particular naming scheme, and I will try and remember to do so in the future. However, whenever you are turning in anything electronically, you would be wise to always **name your files in a way that uniquely identifies them as yours**.
