# Bring Your Eye Protection!

This week, we'll be building our Freeduinos. If you don't wear eye protection, this is what can happen:

Soldering is, by-and-large, very safe. However, we don't wear eye protection because things are *usually* safe; we wear eye protection because of weird accidents we don't expect, and because we all like having depth perception. (Remember... to perceive depth, you must have *two* eyes, not one.)
