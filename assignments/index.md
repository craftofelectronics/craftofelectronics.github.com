# Assignments

These assignments were issued as in-class exercises, as laboratories, or as homework. They are archived here in reverse chronological order, meaning the most recent assignment is the topmost item in the list.

The due dates for these assignments can all be found in the course Moodle site, or on the individual assignment webpages. The Moodle site should (if I've done things correctly) always the the "most correct" place to look for deadlines and assignment submission.
