# Exploring Home Wiring Planning

<img align="right" src="{{site.url}}/images/berea-contrast-house-revised-floorplan-300.png" />

Before we get into the main activities of the day, we're going to take a few minutes to talk about the kinds of home furnishings we want in our Contrast Houses. Do we want a dishwasher? Clothes washer? Dryer? Lights? Ceiling fans? These questions will effect how we ultimately design the wiring plan for our homes.

To do this, you're going to need [the floorplans to the Berea Contrast House]({{site.url}}/downloads/berea-contrast-house-floorplan.pdf) (PDF). You might want to print one or more copies of the first page so you can mark on it as you brainstorm about the layout of the house.

# Collaborative Reading

After deciding on furnishings, we will do some *collaborative reading*. The purpose of reading and working through this particular text with a partner is to make sense of the process of designing a home wiring layout.

This process for structured, pairwise reading looks like the following:

1. Skim the next paragraph.
1. If it does not look critical, mark it "RETURN" and go back to step 1.
1. If it *does* look critical, read the paragraph more closely.
1. With your partner, identify the "big idea" in the paragraph.
1. Together, identify any questions you have; write them down.
1. Go back to step 1.

The document we will be reading is about [developing a plan for wiring your own home](http://handyman-do-it-yourself.com/house-wiring-diagrams/). Along with your partner, you will be developing a plan for the wiring of two rooms in your [Contrast House]({{site.url}}/bereacontrasthouse/). This is the first step: developing an understanding of the issues involved, and the appropriate way in which to annotate your home wiring diagram.

Your notes should be typed, and they should be structured something like this:

<div align="center">

</div>

If yours are structured differently (but clearly, and in a way that is useful to you), that is fine. Unstructured notes are not acceptable.

# Homework (Modified Based on Long Q & A Session)

Finish the reading we started in class for Friday. Before class, submit a Word document containing questions you have from the Reading to Moodle. The document should be named **USERNAME-SQA-1**. (I just abbreviated "Structured Question Answer" as "SQA.")

Moodle Assignment: [Structured Questions](http://moodle.berea.edu/mod/assignment/view.php?id=53381)

<!--
Research one of the questions your partner identified in your structured reading, and write two or three paragraphs about it in a best effort to answer that question. Assume the reader of your document will be another student in <em>Craft of Electronics</em>. Submit your question and answer to Moodle before class on Friday. The document should be named **USERNAME-SQA-1**. (I just abbreviated "Structured Question Answer" as "SQA.")

Make sure your document clearly identifies the question and answer; I will combine these into a single document, and share them (anonymized) back to the entire class.
