## Distributed Rough In Research

For this project, we will be dividing up into teams of 2 and researching different aspects of home electric installation that we need to understand in order to design a correct and safe wiring plan for our Contrast Houses.

1. In class on Friday, we'll devise a list of topics and split up into teams.
1. Over the weekend (Saturday/Sunday), you and your partner should fill in your part of the "code."
1. On Monday, we'll come together and look at what everyone has produced.

### Procedure

1. Do your research, making notes (electronicly or on paper).
1. [Go to the Moodle Wiki for this project](http://moodle.berea.edu/mod/wiki/view.php?id=53949&page=Distributed+Electric+Code+Research)
1. Add your notes.

Remember, you want your notes to be **clear** and **concise**. "Clear" means they are easy to understand. "Concise" means they're not too wordy. However, if they do not say enough, then we won't know how to implement what you propose. Create links to relevant material where appropriate.

### Must Read

All of you must read the article [Rough Electrical Wiring](http://www.finehomebuilding.com/PDF/Free/021144076.pdf) from Fine Homebuilding. It is excellent.

### A Few Links to Get You Started

Once you have read that article, you may find these links are useful resources. You'll need to do some reading to figure out what is useful to you (give your part of the project). 

* [Jefferson County Wiring Guide](http://jeffco.us/jeffco/building_uploads/Electrical_Wiring_Guide_final.pdf)
* [Inspection Checklist from the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry](http://www.dli.mn.gov/ccld/pdf/eli_inspection_checklist.pdf)
* [Typical Electrical Building Codes from Suite 101](http://suite101.com/article/typical-electrical-building-codes-a38682)
* [Ask The Electrician](http://www.ask-the-electrician.com/wiringdiagrams.html) <br/>
  This site is kinda cool because there are lots of embedded audio clips where a guy talks about home wiring.

### And, in Addition

You may also need to do some Googling. I used "residential electrical wiring standards" as a start for my searches; don't be afraid to use other terms as well.
