# Final Report

Your final report will bring together two documents that I will provide extremely rapid-turnaround feedback. They are reports you will write individually, as they give you a chance to bring together, in small vignettes, everything you have learned about this term.

The majority of this report will come from combining your [first prototype](#first_prototype_report) and [second prototype](#second_prototype_report) reports. The final document will also include a [team evaluation](#team_evaluation) and a [personal evaluation](#personal_evaluation) as well.

## First Prototype Report

The first prototype report is composed of two sections: a **Background** and a **Prototype Design** section.

### Background

The background section should first explore the challenge you are trying to solve in a broad way. Then, it would be good to break down the challenge into the sub-problems that need to be solved for a successful, final project. For example, many of you asked excellent questions about motor strength, sensor variability, etc. In breaking the problem down, you are demonstrating that you can think critically about a problem in terms of both its physical challenges as well as how the electronic components (motors, sensors, computation) interact with the world in your system.

### Prototype Design

In describing the prototype design, you bring to bear diagramming and visual documentation skills that you have developed this term. The text of this section should describe the critical functional elements (motor control, sensing, etc.) and relate those descriptions to the diagrams that you include herein. Specifically, you should include:

* A Fritzing diagram of your proposed circuit.
* Photographs of your prototype board.

To be clear: both of these elements should be clean, neat, and professional in presentation. Your Fritzing diagram should neatly route wires via right angles, and your photographs should similarly reflect a board that has been laid out neatly, using right-angles, clear labels, and a clear concern for presentation and professionalism.

For example, here is a vacuum tube circuit that is boarded neatly, and we could easily imagine drawing a schematic from it, or reducing its scale to something suitable for later production.

This is what we should not see in your photographs:

This is much closer to what I would love to see:

#### Submission 

Upload the current state of your document by class time on Monday, December 2nd, and I will provide feedback in Moodle before class on Wednesday.

## Second Prototype Report

The first prototype report is very *declarative*: it demonstrates your ability to document that which is. 

The second prototype report is important *reflective* document: it demonstrates your ability to document your process and your ability to evaluate that process critically. The second prototype report has two parts: a **design evolution** and **next steps**.

### Design Evolution

The design evolution should look at three aspects of your prototype design process.

1. **Brainstorming**. What process did your group employ to generate ideas? How did you identify what ideas were good, which were bad, and which showed promise? What role did you play in that process? 
1. **Refinement**. Once you identified a likely path, how did you go about refining that design idea? What research did your group carry out to refine your design? What role did you play in that process?
1. **Design Decomposition**. What elements did you ultimately decide were critical to your prototype? How did you make those decisions? What role did discussion and research play in that process? What role did you play?

Finally, you should describe the steps your team took to execute on the prototype. Did you divide up tasks? What were they, and why did you break them up the way you did? 

### Next Steps

This section builds on the reflective nature of the previous section by asking you to think hard about **what comes next**. This requires you to extend the process you have engaged in, and think about what would represent the next, successful step in a project of this nature.

The second prototype report describes the process you went through to build your prototype; this section should describe the process you would employ to transform your prototype into a full-scale, functional prototype. What elements could you use as-is? What elements do you feel would need to be revised? What steps do you believe are necessary to transform your prototype from a (possibly) fragile thing into something that, if necessary, could be employed as a live test piece for a few months?

It is possible you may want to do some reading on the 'net regarding the [etching of circuit boards](https://www.google.com/search?q=etching+circuit+boards), as well as some thoughts about [enclosure design](http://blog.ponoko.com/2011/08/12/tutorial-how-to-design-a-laser-cut-project-box/). Of course, you might want to go in a completely different direction; these are ideas to help you think about what else might be done to make your work more permanent/robust as you transform it from a breadboarded prototype to something that we might consider installing.

#### Submission

Upload the current state of your document before Sunday, December 9th, and I will provide feedback in Moodle before Monday, December 10th.


# Team Evaluation

*TBA*.

# Personal Evaluation

*TBA*.

# Final Submission

Your final report, which combines the two prototype reports, your team evaluation, and your personal evaluation is due before 5PM on Friday, December 14th.
