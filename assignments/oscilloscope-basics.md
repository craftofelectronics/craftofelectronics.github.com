# Oscilloscope Basics

In this lab...

### Submission

As with all assignments, you should submit your work to [Moodle](http://moodle.berea.edu/mod/assignment/view.php?id=54287). And, as with all assignments, you should use a sensible filename:

* It should start with your username, which...
* should be followed by a hyphen, which...
* should be followed by the name of the assignment.

For example, I might name my report **jadudm-scopebasics.docx**, or possibly **jadudm-scopelab.docx**, or really anything that matches the pattern **USERNAME-ASSIGNMENT.docx** and will be obvious to both myself and a TA.
