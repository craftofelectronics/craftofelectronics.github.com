# Oscilloscope Basics

The purposes of the oscilloscope basics lab is twofold:

1. **To become aquainted with the oscilloscope**. <br/>
   Specifically, we will learn to measure parts of a time-varying signal, save data from our oscilloscope, and then use common tools (Excel or Google Spreadsheets) to analyze that data.
1. **To work on our written communication skills in a formal context.** <br/>
   Because the lab does not involve any unstructured, creative components, it will allow us to focus on professional writing and reporting skills in a straightforward way.

### Before You Begin

You should have watched the video [How to Use an Oscilloscope](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzY2abWCVTY) by mjlorton on YouTube. I later found the 4-minute-long [Oscilloscope Tutorial Part 2 - Basic usage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUIgAu3QQWQ&feature=plcp&list=SPCADC2B237AFE4689) by AfrotechMods to be concise and useful as well.

### Parts of the Scope

I've printed out pictures of your scope. With your partner, you should label the parts of the scope and make note of what they do. Add this to your notebook for later reference. (FIXME: Create CRAFTOE Flickr account and add pictures.)

### Submission

As with all assignments, you should submit your work to [Moodle](http://moodle.berea.edu/mod/assignment/view.php?id=54287). And, as with all assignments, you should use a sensible filename:

* It should start with your username, which...
* should be followed by a hyphen, which...
* should be followed by the name of the assignment.

For example, I might name my report **jadudm-scopebasics.docx**, or possibly **jadudm-scopelab.docx**, or really anything that matches the pattern **USERNAME-ASSIGNMENT.docx** and will be obvious to both myself and a TA.
