# Excel Basics

In class I walked through the transformation of temperature data from our "not-yet-a-thermostat." The steps we took:

1. Converting the data from a text file (comma-separated) to an Excel spreadsheet.
1. Fixing my mistake (I started the sensor at 11:00 instead of 23:00).
1. Creating a column of labels (so we could label our data "23:16" and the like).
1. Plotting the data.
1. Prettying up the Excel plot.

I've [put together a YouTube video of this process](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vc-_UGa6f0); because I am traveling, I could not narrate it. This, however, means you have a homework assignment...

# Homework

First, you'll want to [download the text file that was generated by my temperature sensor]({{site.url}}/downloads/LOG00010.txt). You may need to right-click this link and do a "Save As" to download this file.

Then, watch the [YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vc-_UGa6f0) that I created for you. (If the video wiggles around, it is because I made the video while riding in a car.) As you watch, create a set of instructions (notes, if you will) that detail how you would recreate these transformations on your own copy of the data. Your notes should be detailed enough that someone who is familiar with Microsoft Word (but **not** familiar with Microsoft Excel) could recreate the transformations. This means you need to be explicit and clear about what menus that you select, what actions that you take, and so on.

When you are done, you should have both a spreadsheet with the temperature logger data (transformed) as well as a set of instructions that would help someone else carry out those instructions. [Submit both your transformed spreadsheet and your notes to Moodle](http://moodle.berea.edu/mod/assignment/view.php?id=57615). This is due by class on Wednesday, but I recommend you do it sooner, as we will be proceeding with other work starting Monday. 

Please name your files something along the lines of **username-temperature-data-numbers.xlsx** for the spreadsheet and **username-temperature-data-instructions.docx** for the instructions you write up.

As motivation for why you may want these notes to be crystal clear: if you are asked to do this under exam conditions, you might be allowed to use these notes. Hence, using section headings for each major section, and numbered lists for the interim steps is probably a good idea.

# Excel Tips

These notes are to help remind you of what we did in class. You can, of course, Google for any particular topic that you might have questions about, or use the help built into Excel.

1. [Naming a range of cells](http://www.contextures.com/xlNames01.html)
1. [Selecting non-adjacent columns](http://spreadsheets.about.com/od/exceltips/qt/8830nonadjacent.htm)
1. [Moving a column](http://superuser.com/questions/178222/excel-keyboard-shortcut-to-move-swap-column-left-or-right)
1. [Referencing cells in another sheet](http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/1604/excel_how_to_reference_cells_in_other_worksheets/)
1. [Creating a scatterplot](http://www.ncsu.edu/labwrite/res/gt/graphtut-home.html)
1. [Change the name of a data series](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/change-data-series-names-or-legend-text-HP005198820.aspx)


In this video, I walk you through a transformation of sensor data from our temperature loggers. If you entered your time correctly, you won't need to do everything I do here in order to produce a plot.
