#  Jigsaw Reading Re: Thermostats

First, Jigsaw Cat has something to say:

Now that we have that out of the way...

## Jigsaw Reading

You will be reading your paper. When we come in on Monday, we will first discuss the paper in our own groups---that is, you'll talk about it with people who read the same paper as you. **Then**, we will be mixing with people who read *other* papers, and you will share with them your understandings. Finally, we'll come together as a class and identify highlights.

If you come unprepared, you will negatively impact three other people in the class.

To help you read effectively and prepare for this activity, I thought you might start with a short paper titled *How to Read a Paper*.

## How To Read a Paper

First, you should download this PDF and read it.

[How To Read a Paper](http://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/home/Papers/data/07/paper-reading.pdf)

It is short (2 pages), and describes a 3-pass approach to reading a technical paper. I recommend you read this, and then use this approach in our reading this weekend. 

Why? If all you do is read your assigned paper once, I suspect you won't really be ready for class on Monday. I suspect you won't end up taking 5 hours on your third pass... but, if it only takes you 20 minutes to read your assigned paper, you probably haven't spent enough time on it.

## Jigsaw Groups

I've used initials only to protect the innocent from exposure to the Internet.

* SL, AK, BC, HM (Fried/Camenzind): [The Energy Dashboard: Improving the Visibility of Energy Consumption at a Campus-Wide Scale](http://www.solaripedia.com/files/753.pdf)
* SC, TB, JP, SB (Hertz/Gilbert): [How People Actually Use Thermostats](http://acs.lbl.gov/~aragon/pubs/ACEEE_2010.pdf)
* AH, JS, DS, CD (Kare/...): [Occupancy Sensing Adaptive Thermostat Controls: A Market Review and Observations from Multiple Field Installations in University Residence Halls](http://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2012/data/papers/0193-000245.pdf)
* CS, GS, MN, LH (Tesla/Keller/...): [Effects of Thermostat Setting on Energy Consumption](http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/odpub/pdf/63816.pdf)
* NH, BK, ET, MY (Boykin/...): Two readings. First, read this blog post on the [Energy Vanguard blog](http://www.energyvanguard.com/blog-building-science-HERS-BPI/), [The Case Against High Thermostat Setbacks](http://www.energyvanguard.com/blog-building-science-HERS-BPI/bid/50068/GUEST-POST-The-Case-Against-High-Thermostat-Setbacks). Then, [read the rebuttal](http://www.energyvanguard.com/blog-building-science-HERS-BPI/bid/50152/If-You-Think-Thermostat-Setbacks-Don-t-Save-Energy-You-re-Wrong).

## What To Do

For the sake of clarity:

1. **Read [the paper about reading papers](http://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/home/Papers/data/07/paper-reading.pdf)**. This describes a process of reading AND taking notes about a paper that will serve you well in this weekend's work.
1. **Read the paper you've been assigned**. This paper is typically between 5 and 10 pages. Use the three-pass approach you've just read about, and make sure you end up with clear notes about the paper. Develop questions you might ask your reading group when you come in, so that all of you understand the content of the paper.
1. **Develop notes**. Make sure you have clear notes that will help you describe the content of the paper to classmates who have not read it.

In class, we will:

1. **Discuss** the paper with a group of people who **have** read the paper.
1. **Share** the content of the paper with people who **have not** read the paper.

And, afterwards, we will:

1. **Share** our notes and reflections online so that everyone can benefit from our own work and learning.

The afterwards will be assigned separately.
