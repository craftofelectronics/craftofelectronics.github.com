<p>This is the first time <em>Craft of Electronics</em> has been offered, and <a href='contributors.html'>with contributions from many</a>, this course has been designed to be distinctly Berean. It is possible that the syllabus will need to change as we progress through the semester; if that is the case, we will discuss those changes as a class, thus making the course better for us and for students who take the course in the future.</p>

<h2 id='what_this_course_is_about'>What This Course is About</h2>

<p>We will study how to safely work with electricity and digital electronics to study and control the world around us.</p>

<p>If this was the <em>only</em> course in electricity and electronics you take at Berea College, and you never touch or study the subject again while you are a student, what do we hope you will remember 10 years from now?</p>
<br />
<ol>
<li><strong>We want to be safe in everything we do</strong>. <br /> People who do not respect electricity are dangerous to themselves and others. Safety is the most important thing you can learn in <em>Craft of Electronics</em>.</li>

<li><strong>We want to build things</strong>. <br /> We will learn to think with our hands as we build electrical systems; if you can hold a pencil, you can build electronics.</li>

<li><strong>We want to design solutions to our own problems</strong>. <br /> We study electricity and electronics because it enables us to better understand ourselves and our environment&#8212;and control that environment as well.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id='course_objectives'>Course Objectives</h2>

<ul>
<li>Demonstrate proper safety precautions related to equipment.</li>

<li>Define voltage, resistance, current amperage, direct current, alternating current, and power supply.</li>

<li>Identify electrical components and their associated values</li>

<li>Interpret and create schematic diagrams of electrical circuits</li>

<li>Explain the basic principles and operation of varied electrical/electronic components</li>

<li>Implement Ohm&#8217;s Law to calculate voltage, current, and resistance problems.</li>

<li><em>Create, calculate, and service simple series, parallel, and series-parallel circuits.</em></li>

<li><em>Identify and explain the concepts of both DC and AC power systems and associated circuits.</em></li>

<li><em>Calculate values for AC and DC resistive, inductive, and capacitive components.</em></li>

<li>Correctly utilize various measurement tools to identify and measure results of AC and DC laboratory exercises.</li>
</ul>

<p>Italicised objectives may be expressed differently in the first offering of TAD 265.</p>

<h2 id='materials_online'>Materials Online</h2>

<ul>
<li>We will use Moodle, provided by Berea College, for handing in assignments.</li>

<li>We will use <a href='http://dropbox.com/'>Dropbox</a> for making sure we never lose our work.</li>

<li>We will use <a href='http://ifttt.com/'>If This Then That (IFTTT)</a> to keep track of course announcements.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='required_text_and_materials'>Required Text and Materials</h2>

<p>The following are <em>required</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Forrest M. Mims III, <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-Electronics-Forrest-Mims/dp/0945053282/ref=pd_sim_b_6'>Getting Started in Electronics</a></li>

<li><strong>A Freeduino Kit</strong>. Pick up a voucher at the bookstore. Surrender it to Matt for a kit.</li>

<li>A notebook.</li>

<li>Safety Goggles.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following texts are <em>completely optional</em>. This means they will add to your experience in the course (if you read them), but I will not be assigning anything from them. Put another way: <strong>you do not need to buy these books</strong>. You might want to, though.</p>

<ol>

</ol>

<h2 id='required_convocations'>Required Convocations</h2>

<p>As students, you are expected to attend 7 events from the <a href='http://www.berea.edu/convocations/'>Berea Convocation Series</a> per term. For this course, I am requiring that you attend <strong>three</strong> of these convocations.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dr. Lyle Roelofs (Aug 30, 3PM): <a href='http://www.berea.edu/convocations/events/2012-2013/dr-lyle-roelofs.asp'>Why Berea?</a><br /> Why this convo? Because Dr. Roelofs is our new President, and we should get to know him. A scientist of deep faith, he and his wife join us to listen and lead.</li>

<li>Hasan Davis &#8216;92 (Oct 4, 3PM): <a href='http://www.berea.edu/convocations/events/2012-2013/founders-day-convocation.asp'>A.A. Burleigh: The Long Climb to Freedom</a><br /> <a href='http://www.hasandavis.com/Hasan.html'>Hasan Davis</a> is a Berea grad who has pursued his passions, and they have led him many fascinating and amazing places. Likewise, A. A. Burleigh (whom Davis will portray) is another Berea graduate&#8212;the first African-American to graduate from Berea College. This convo is about the power of passions, and how (in their pursuit), you are capable of anything.</li>

<li>Dr. Lisa Dodson (Nov 29, 3PM): <a href='http://www.berea.edu/convocations/events/2012-2013/dr-lisa-dodson.asp'>The Moral Underground: How Ordinary People Subvert an Unfair Economy</a><br /> You do not need to be Apple Computer to transform the world through digital electronics. The <em>craft</em> of electronics provides an avenue by which we might transform our world, and in doing so, support ourselves and others. Dr. Dodson provides a context for these ideas.</li>
</ul>

<p>I recommend <a href='http://www.berea.edu/convocations/events/2012-2013/california-guitar-trio.asp'>The California Guitar Trio</a>, but do not require you attend it. I have also been told that A.A. Burleigh (Berea grad) will be excellent.</p>

<h2 id='course_prerequisites'>Course Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Completion or waiver of MAT 012 or permission of instructor.</p>

<h2 id='attendance_policy'>Attendance Policy</h2>

<p>We will institute, as a community, a process by which we regularly engage in <strong>peer evaluations</strong>. Through these, we will evaluate each other&#8217;s contributions to projects, with particular emphasis on whether we were supportive of our colleagues and committed to excellence in our work. This may not mean we <em>achieved</em> excellence, but we should have been present in class and at meetings, attentive, responsible, and respectful of each other.</p>

<h3 id='my_role'>My Role</h3>

<p>In the event that peer evaluations do not provide us with an effective mechanism for building a mutually supportive community in the classroom, I reserve the right to &#8220;step in.&#8221; If your attendance becomes problematic (more than 3 unexcused absences total or two in a single week), 5% will be subtracted from your total, final grade for the third and each subsequent absence. Five absences total may result in failure of the course.</p>

<h2 id='technology_policies'>Technology Policies</h2>

<p>Much of the work in this course will require use of the computer, so these policies are designed to help you better understand how to be effective in a technology-rich environment.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Laptop and Software</strong>: We will regularly make use of laptops during class, and you are expected to have them unless explicitly stated otherwise.</li>

<li><strong>Unapproved Technology</strong>: Technology often disrupts, rather than enhances, our day-to-day lives. <strong>We will be responsible, as individuals, to manage technology like the adults that we are</strong>. We will support each-other in making good decisions about this in class by reminding each-other politely, if necessary, that SMS, Facebook, and similar tools rarely have a place in our classroom.</li>

<li><strong>Communication</strong>: The course website is your primary source for information about CRAFToE; our Moodle site will be used for posting grades and assignment submission. Messages about the course will often be sent by email. These are all mechanisms you would likely use in a professional position in the real world (corporate websites, internal content management systems, and email)&#8212;you are, likewise, expected to use them in a responsible and professional manner in this course.</li>

<li><strong>Backups</strong>: All students are expected to back-up their work on a daily basis, which includes laboratories, assignments, and quizzes. The best way to do this is to store a copy of all work in a cloud service such as Dropbox, SkyDrive, Google Drive, or to use a DVD, flash drive, or some other media. Storing multiple copies of something on your laptop is not a backup. I will not be sympathetic to lost work in any way, shape, or form.</li>

<li><strong>Exceptions</strong>: Exceptions to any of these technology policies will be considered on an individual case-by-case basis but will only be granted under extreme circumstances.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='collaboration_and_teamwork'>Collaboration and Teamwork</h2>

<p>Team participation is a proven and useful means by which students can learn material. Further, it is usually the first thing employers ask for of students in computing and electronics: <em>we need people who can work on teams</em>. CRAFToE was designed for you to work with a classmate throughout the term.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>All in-class work in CRAFToE is collaborative unless otherwise specified. When you work with one or more teammates on a project, it is critical that you always clearly identify:</p>

<ol>
<li>The names of all contributors.</li>

<li>The work that each individual contributed.</li>

<li>A peer evaluation. (More TBA.)</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>Homework is assumed to be individual in all cases.<br /> <strong>To be clear</strong>: this does not mean that you may not discuss challenges with your peers. It <em>does</em> mean that you are expected to submit your own work, and it should represent your own best effort in learning. I am available (both in office hours and by appointment), and and there are evening laboratories where you can seek further support as well.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>All assignments and labs should be handed in with the author(s) acknowledging all of the help received throughout the assignment. (This includes significant help received from the instructors or in the TAs).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Please be careful to conform to these standards for teamwork, since they are designed to encourage good learning practices. (Furthermore, copying another person&#8217;s work or otherwise failing to adhere to these standards may even result in a charge of academic dishonesty.) <strong>I will make use of the institutional policies laid down regarding academic dishonesty.</strong> In the real world, plagiarism and claiming others&#8217; work as your own could result in you losing your job. Our goal is to support you in your learning, and copying the work of others (or inappropriately reusing work found on the WWW) never constitutes good learning. <strong>CITING YOUR WORK is always, always essential.</strong></p>

<h2 id='grade_distribution'>Grade Distribution</h2>
<table>
<tr> <td> Work </td> <td> 60% </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Midterms </td> <td> 12% each </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Final </td> <td> 16% </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>&#8220;Work&#8221; means work done in-class, homeworks, laboratories, presentations, etc. as assessed by the instructor, TAs, or (if appropriate) your peers. Put simply, &#8220;more than half of your grade comes from doing excellent work throughout the course.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id='grading_scale'>Grading Scale</h2>

<p>The <a href='http://www.berea.edu/cataloghandbook/academics/aps/grades/gradingscale.asp'>Berea College grading scale</a> makes clear that:</p>

<ul>
<li>An <strong>A</strong> represents <strong>excellent</strong> work,</li>

<li>A <strong>B</strong> represents <strong>good</strong> work, and</li>

<li>A <strong>C</strong> represents <strong>competent</strong> work.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Excellent</strong> work means that it is free of typographic errors, is well organized, submitted on time, and shows clear attention to detail and a desire to produce the best work possible. It is likely that you will need to complete work in advance of the deadline and discuss it with me before you submit it, revising your assignment based on feedback. It is likely that you will never be able to do work the night before it is due and produce something of excellent quality.</p>

<p><strong>Good</strong> work may have minor grammatical errors, but still shows commitment to producing the best work possible. It is organized, is not late, but it is possible you did not seek help and revision before you submitted your work. If you&#8217;re exceptional, you might (once in a <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxjaQV0ob2E'>blue moon</a>), pull off good work at the last minute. But, don&#8217;t count on it.</p>

<p>Most work that any of us do is <strong>competent</strong>. Care and effort is needed even to get to this stage, but it is likely that you still have errors, could revise more, and did not give the work as much time as it needed to get to this point. Competent work is something you should be proud of, but I always ask that you strive to do better.</p>

<ul>
<li>An <strong>A</strong> is in the range of 91% to 100%</li>

<li>A <strong>B</strong> is in the range of 81% to 90%</li>

<li>A <strong>C</strong> is in the range of 71% to 80%</li>

<li>A <strong>D</strong> is in the range of 61% to 70%</li>

<li>An <strong>F</strong> is a grade of 60% or lower.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <strong>plus</strong> may be earned through exceptional attendance, teamwork, professionalism and collegiality, and participation. A <strong>plus</strong> is completely at the discretion of the instructor.</p>

<p><strong>Any questions regarding grades should never be directed at TAs, but instead always directed to the instructor of the course.</strong></p>

<h2 id='class_atmosphere'>Class Atmosphere</h2>

<p>I want many things for students in my classes, and I very much want you to help me achieve these goals.</p>

<ul>
<li>I want our laboratory to be a relaxed environment where you are <strong>comfortable trying new things</strong> and (sometimes) failing. By &#8220;failure&#8221; I do not mean &#8220;receiving an F,&#8221; but I do mean that you try things, make mistakes, and learn from them. The last bit&#8212;learning from our mistakes&#8212;is the critical part. Neither I, nor you, nor your classmates should put down or belittle a classmate for trying.</li>

<li>I want you to <strong>look forward to CRAFToE because it is fun</strong>. We should be comfortable with each other&#8212;humor and laughter makes the day go faster and better. That said&#8230;</li>

<li>We should <strong>work hard, and be proud of that effort</strong>. For me, a &#8220;fun&#8221; day is one where I&#8217;ve worked hard and improved myself. I have done my best to design a course that will be fun because it challenges us to work hard and do new and interesting things.</li>

<li><strong>Respect matters</strong>. Respect for each-other, regardless of where we are from and where we are on our life journey is of utmost importance. I have a great deal of respect for your effort as a student; I show that respect by challenging you to extend your limits, and supporting you to the best of my ability as you take risks and engage with the course throughout the semester.</li>
</ul>

<p>In years past, I used Chickering and Gamson&#8217;s <a href='http://www.uis.edu/liberalstudies/students/documents/sevenprinciples.pdf'>Seven Principles of Good Undergraduate Education</a> (PDF) as my guide; in many ways, they still apply. However, as Bereans, we are all committed to the eight <a href='http://www.berea.edu/about/documents/GreatCommitments.pdf'>Great Commitments</a> (PDF); I ask that we aspire to those as we challenge and learn with each other in this course.</p>

<h2 id='catalogue_description'>Catalogue Description</h2>

<p>Electrical Fundamentals is a study of the theory and techniques necessary for electrical and electronic systems and their associated equipment. Students will learn how to identify, calculate, measure, create, and repair basic electrical and electronic systems. These skills will be applied to a selection of practical projects that will challenge the students understanding of the material and problem solving/troubleshooting abilities. Topics may include AC/DC circuits, resistance, power, various components, and use of electrical measuring instruments. <em>Practical Reasoning with Quantitative Emphasis (PRQ).</em></p>

<h2 id='evening_lab__support'>Evening Lab / Support</h2>

<p>The Computing and Digital Crafts Lab is open Sunday through Thursday from 7:30 to 9:00 PM (except on evenings of convocations). The primary teaching assistant and several other TAs will be able to answer questions about the content in the course during consultations in their Lab hours. You are strongly encouraged to make use of the help available in the Computing and Digital Crafts Lab, as well as in the instructors&#8217; office hours. Best results are obtained trying to solve problems before asking for help, and you should be prepared to show what you have already tried. Topics in this course build throughout the course, so you should be sure to do your best to keep up with the class, so as to not fall behind. No question to which you do not know the answer is &#8220;dumb&#8221; unless it goes unanswered because it remained unasked.</p>

<h2 id='statement_regarding_disability'>Statement Regarding Disability</h2>

<p>Students who have a disability that may prevent them from fully demonstrating their abilities should contact Cindy Reed, MSW, LCSW, the Disability Services Coordinator at (859) 985-3212, or by email at <a href='mailto:cynthia_reed@berea.edu'>cynthia_reed@berea.edu</a>, to discuss accommodations necessary to ensure full participation in this course. Upon request, this syllabus can be made available in alternative forms.</p>
