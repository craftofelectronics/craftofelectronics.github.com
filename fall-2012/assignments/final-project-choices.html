      <h1 id='final_project_choices'>Final Project Choices</h1>

<p>Thinking about final projects, it would be nice if they brought together our four long-term commitments:</p>

<ol>
<li>Safety</li>

<li>Design</li>

<li>Fabrication</li>

<li>Communication</li>
</ol>

<p>We want a project that we can develop, test, and deploy safely. To do that, we will need to design carefully, considering how we build equipment that is safe to use (it won&#8217;t catch on fire) and safe to interact with (it won&#8217;t hurt us or anyone else). Our fabrication should be of high quality, and we want to communicate clearly and with pride the results of our efforts.</p>

<h3 id='ideas'>Ideas</h3>

<p>You are encouraged to suggest other ideas. That said, I would like it if our project ideas were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Useful (to us and possibly to others)</li>

<li>Achievable</li>
</ol>

<p>The second criterion means &#8220;with the time allowed, we can accomplish our task.&#8221;</p>

<p>Possible project ideas include:</p>

<h4 id='safety_timer_for_hot_water_pot'>Safety Timer for Hot Water Pot</h4>

<p>I have a hot water pot. I always forget to turn it off. I would like it if it turned off automatically after 1-5 hours.</p>

<h4 id='power_outage_detector'>Power Outage Detector</h4>

<p>The SENS greenhouse has fish tanks. If they lose power, they lose air circulation in the tanks&#8230; which can lead to a loss of fish. We&#8217;d like to know if we lost power in the greenhouse within 5 minutes of it happening.</p>

<h4 id='passive_air_valve_control'>Passive Air Valve Control</h4>

<p>The SENS house has a passive heating system. This means that light warms the greenhouse, and then that warm air is vented into the rest of the house. Unfortunately, someone has to remember to open that vent&#8230; and if people forget, then no warm air is vented into the house. We should be able to automate this process.</p>

<h4 id='rfid_machine_lockout'>RFID Machine Lockout</h4>

<p>We would like to prevent people from using machines in the shops. Specifically, we&#8217;d like to modify our machines so that their power cables have a &#8220;smart box&#8221; in the middle. The box normally keeps the power to the machine off. However, if you have an RFID card (an access card), and if you&#8217;re certified to use the machine (you have been trained and have demonstrated how to use it safely), then the power will be turned on.</p>

<h4 id='smart_blinds'>Smart Blinds</h4>

<p>The electronics lab gets some wicked bright sun at 8AM in the morning. It is so bright that it is hard to read computer screens and even to look around at classmates who are backed by the windows. I&#8217;d love some blinds that can be remotely controlled to raise and lower over the windows. Perhaps they could even be &#8220;smart blinds&#8221; and automatically go down when the sun is directly hitting the windows, and go up after the sun goes high enough in the sky.</p>

<h4 id='classroom_clock'>Classroom Clock</h4>

<p>We need a clock for the classroom. It would be <em>really</em> cool if it had a traditional pendulum mechanism, but if instead of using that to mechanically drive a clock, we turned that into electricity (perhaps with a small motor, which is kinda the same as a generator), and that powered an Arduino-based clock. Either way, it should be big, beautiful, and be made of wood. With some LEDs.</p>

<h1 id='other_ideas'>Other Ideas?</h1>

<p>There are many other ideas, but those are a few that I&#8217;m aware of around our building and around campus at the moment. Mind you, I&#8217;ve only been here a few months&#8230; there are probably more ideas hiding out there.</p>

<p>Think about these possibilities, and what kinds of things you&#8217;d be most interested in working on. We&#8217;ll talk more about this soon.</p>
