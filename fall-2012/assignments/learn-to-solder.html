      <h1 id='learn_to_solder'>Learn to Solder</h1>

<p><strong>Due</strong>: Friday at the start of class.</p>

<p><strong>Submission</strong>: Signed off in class.</p>

<p>Before you begin soldering, you should do some research. What I&#8217;ve suggested here is a set of videos and readings that should get you ready to come to class and begin practicing your craft.</p>

<h2 id='quick_videos_from_nasa_tuesday_evening'>Quick Videos from NASA (Tuesday Evening)</h2>

<p>First, take a look at these six videos:</p>

<p><a href='http://radiojove.gsfc.nasa.gov/telescope/soldering.htm'>http://radiojove.gsfc.nasa.gov/telescope/soldering.htm</a></p>

<p>These are very quick.</p>

<h3 id='taking_notes'>Taking Notes</h3>

<p>While you watch this video, make note of any practices that you think are <strong>Essential Practices</strong> and any things that seem like <strong>Bad Practices</strong>. You might start by creating two categories, and writing down things that you feel fall into either category.</p>

<p>I may ask to see these notes, so please 1) put them in your notebook for reference. You are welcome, if you like, to keep your notes in a Word or Libre Office document. Remember to keep it backed up (Dropbox, etc.).</p>

<h2 id='curious_inventor_wednesday_evening'>Curious Inventor (Wednesday Evening)</h2>

<p><a href='http://curiousinventor.com'>Curious Inventor</a> has some excellent resources that you can reference. I would recommend you work your way through three of them:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href='http://store.curiousinventor.com/guides/how_to_solder/cleantip'>Tinning the Tip</a></li>

<li><a href='http://store.curiousinventor.com/guides/how_to_solder/heat_solder'>Heat and Solder the Joint</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Curious Inventor has <a href='http://store.curiousinventor.com/guides/how_to_solder/ref'>many more</a> references for you to consider.</p>

<h3 id='taking_notes'>Taking Notes</h3>

<p>While watching the videos here and reading, continue to expand your previous categories. Also, make note of any other things that you think are important. You should be working towards your own step-by-step &#8220;how to&#8221; guide. Someone who is new to soldering should be able to use your notes as a &#8220;rich outline&#8221; for how to solder. (In other words, a few words here-and-there does not cut it.)</p>

<h2 id='nates_rules_wednesday_evening'>Nate&#8217;s Rules (Wednesday Evening)</h2>

<p><a href='http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/106'>Nate has six rules.</a> I suggest you read them, and possibly take a few notes. You&#8217;ll understand these better when you&#8217;ve started soldering, but they&#8217;re 1) very practical and 2) are dead on in terms of &#8220;the right thing to do&#8221; when you&#8217;re using a soldering iron.</p>

<h3 id='taking_notes'>Taking Notes</h3>

<p>You could print these rules out and put them in your notebook. Highlight/underline as you see fit.</p>

<h2 id='soldering_tips_thursday_evening'>Soldering Tips (Thursday Evening)</h2>

<p><a href='http://www.ladyada.net/media/common/soldering.pdf'>This PDF</a> is thorough but readable. Skim this document, and read in more depth those sections that you think will be most useful to you.</p>

<h3 id='taking_notes'>Taking Notes</h3>

<p>Use it to help you go back through your notes from Tuesday and Wednesday, and make sure you have a good &#8220;short guide&#8221; of your own. (I&#8217;m assuming your guide will be 1-2 pages of notes, depending on how verbose you are.)</p>

<p>There are parts of this guide that are <em>not very relevant</em> to you. This is common when reading all sorts of documentation: there are things you need/want to know, and things you don&#8217;t. As you&#8217;re using this document to fill out your own notes, see if you can identify those sections that are not very useful.(For example&#8212;and this would be hard for you to know in advance&#8212;you will not be working with enameled components, so the section titled &#8220;CLEANING AND TINNING HEAT-STRIPPABLE ENAMELED LEADS&#8221; is not useful to you. The entire section &#8220;Regarding Solders&#8221; is also not very useful, because you have no choice in what kind of solder you will use in this class.)</p>

<h2 id='building_your_freeduino_thursday_evening'>Building your Freeduino (Thursday Evening)</h2>

<p>Finally, you should come somewhat prepared to begin working on your Arduino.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDDC57FBF3063BEFF'>http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDDC57FBF3063BEFF</a></p>

<p>This playlist contains 5 movies that are 18 minutes long (in total). I&#8217;d suggest watching only the first video in advance, and you can watch the other videos while you are doing the build.</p>

<h3 id='taking_notes'>Taking Notes</h3>

<p>I don&#8217;t think you need to take any notes on these videos.</p>

<h1 id='submission'>Submission</h1>

<p>Before class begins on Friday, either myself or the TA need to look at your notes and sign off that you are prepared to begin working on your Freeduino. By this, I mean that I would like to see notes in your notebook that are:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Well organized</strong>. At the least, they need to be legible.</li>

<li><strong>Comprehensive</strong>. At the least, your notes should demonstrate you know what soldering is.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you would prefer to type your notes and print them out, you are welcome to do so.</p>

<h3 id='unprepared'>Unprepared?</h3>

<p>If you have not done the research this week, and have no notes to show, then you will not begin work on your Freeduino. You will need to make this up on your own time. You can, instead of getting to work, use the two hour class period to do research.</p>
