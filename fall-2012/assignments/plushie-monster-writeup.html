      <section>
      <h1 id='plushie_monster_writeup'>Plushie Monster Writeup</h1>

<p><strong>Due</strong>: Friday, September 7th</p>

<p><strong>Submission</strong>: <a href='http://moodle.berea.edu/mod/assignment/view.php?id=53059'>Moodle</a></p>

<p>Not all of our projects will be reported on in writing&#8212;some will involve video, and some may involve live presentations and/or posters. Reporting serves many purposes:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Reflection</strong>. <br /> Writing about what we have done lets us reflect on the process and what we have learned.</li>

<li><strong>Communication Skills</strong>. <br /> Much of what we do after college involves effective communication. We get better at it through practice.</li>

<li><strong>Quantitative Skills</strong>. <br /> When we are making something, we often do calculations to make sure our final product will be correct. However, it is through reporting and reflection that we begin to see how the theory informs our practice, as well as the other way around.</li>
</ol>

<p>For simplicity, this first report will be written.</p>

<h2 id='report_sections'>Report Sections</h2>

<p>Your report should contain <strike>5</strike> 4 sections:</p>

<ol>
<li>Background</li>

<li>Theory</li>

<li>Process and Implementation</li>

<li>Results and Reflection</li>
</ol>

<h3 id='background'>Background.</h3>

<p>Your background should help the reader understand your project. By &#8220;your reader&#8221; I do not mean &#8220;Professor Jadud.&#8221; You should assume the reader of your report has 1) never been in this class and 2) has no particular experience with your tools and equipment, but the reader is interested in what you have to say. So, for this report, you might consider a bit of information about:</p>

<ol>
<li>The project (in overview)</li>

<li>The LilyTiny</li>

<li>Any other unique tools you think that are worth mentioning (LEDs, conductive thread, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>To write about these things, you may need to do some research.</p>

<h3 id='theory'>Theory</h3>

<p>The theory section in this report is not particularly quantitative, but there <em>is theory in this project</em>. For example, there is theory with respect to how circuits are constructed. To make an LED light, there needs to be a power source, an LED, and a connection back to the other side of the battery. Your circuit may have looked a bit more complex. You should probably talk about how a simple circuit is formed as well as what your particular circuit was.</p>

<h3 id='process_and_implementation'>Process and Implementation</h3>

<p>This is &#8220;how you built it.&#8221; Photos are useful here, as well as a narrative description of the important parts of your build process. You might not spend a lot of time talking about how you cut felt (that is easy/obvious), but you might take a bit of time to talk about any interesting problems you had to solve to make things work.</p>

<h3 id='results_and_reflection'>Results and Reflection</h3>

<p>What was the result? This section is where you <strong>step back and reflect as a maker</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>What about your process worked well, and what could you improve next time?</li>

<li>Did you learn a new skill or develop a new interest as part of this work?</li>

<li>How was the experience different from what you expected?</li>

<li>What did you like about this experience? What did you dislike?</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, you might focus on just one of these, and consider how you will build upon or improve your experience in the future.</p>

<h3 id='submission'>Submission</h3>

<p><em>Added Friday, September 7th, after assignments were turned in. This section is apparently necessary, so that everyone names their files correctly.</em></p>

<p>As with all assignments, you should submit your work to <a href='http://moodle.berea.edu/mod/assignment/view.php?id=53059'>Moodle</a>. And, as with all assignments, you should use a sensible filename:</p>

<ul>
<li>It should start with your username, which&#8230;</li>

<li>should be followed by a hyphen, which&#8230;</li>

<li>should be followed by the name of the assignment.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, I would name my report <strong>jadudm-plushiemonster.docx</strong>.</p>
