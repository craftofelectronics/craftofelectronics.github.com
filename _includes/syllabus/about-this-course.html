We will study how to safely work with electricity and digital electronics to
study and control the world around us.

If this was the *only* course in electricity and electronics you take at Berea College, and you never touch or study the subject again while you are a student, what do we hope you will remember 10 years from now?

<br/>

1. **We want to be safe in everything we do**. <br/>
  People who do not respect electricity are dangerous to themselves and others. Safety is the most important thing you can learn in *Craft of Electronics*.
1. **We want to build things**. <br/>
  We will learn to think with our hands as we build electrical systems; if you can hold a pencil, you can build electronics.
1. **We want to design solutions to our own problems**. <br/>
  We study electricity and electronics because it enables us to better understand ourselves and our environment---and control that environment as well.
