## Course Design Contributors

The initial design of this course was carried out at Berea College during the summer of 2012. Many people contributed to this work in a variety of ways.

* [Sebastian Dziallas](http://blog.sdziallas.com/) (Olin College '13) spent the summer collaborating closely on the design of *Craft of Electronics*, brainstorming activities and overall course structure.
* [Mel Chua](http://melchua.com/) is a PhD student at Purdue University, and helped kickstart the design, as well as ask hard questions throughout the process.
* [Jan Pearce](http://faculty.berea.edu/pearcej/) is a Professor of Computer Science at Berea College, and provided critical institutional context throughout the design process.
* Danny Barnes (Berea College '13) contributed to the course design and provided feedback about the course structure and exercises throughout the summer.
* Faculty in the [Technology and Applied Design](http://www.berea.edu/tia/) program provided insight regarding the TAD curriculum and the role of the study of electricity and electronics therein.

## The Berea Contrast House

* [Paul Campbell](http://makecnc.com/) of [MakeCNC.com](http://MakeCNC.com/) believed in the vision of the *Craft of Electronics* and designed the most excellent model of the [Berea Contrast House]({{ site.base }}/bereacontrasthouse/) that we use in the course.
* [Harry Rice](http://www.berea.edu/hutchinslibrary/people/harryrice.asp) and [Shannon Wilson](http://www.berea.edu/hutchinslibrary/people/shannonwilson.asp) provided insight and support in obtaining blueprints nad other source materials related to the Berea Contrast House.
* [Jan Pearce](http://faculty.berea.edu/pearcej/) had the critical insight that the Contrast House was a uniquely Berea context for the study of electricity and electronics on a model scale.

## Flow

The [Flow](http://github.com/craftofelectronics/flow/) programming environment builds on more than 25 years of work regarding concurrent and parallel languages. Flow targets the [Transterpreter](http://transterpreter.org/), a small, portable virtual machine, which executes [occam-pi](http://occam-pi.org/) bytecode on the Arduino (and other platforms). Without this infrastructure, Flow would not be possible. More about the projects that Flow builds upon (including downloads, source, and documentation) can be found online at [http://concurrency.cc/](http://concurrency.cc/).
