## Monday

1. Q & A (0+ min) <br/>
  We'll begin with questions and answers from the reading.
1. Prep Quiz (5 min) <br/>
  A short prep quiz. We'll discuss the role they play when we're talking about the syllabus.
1. Discuss and Compare (10 min) <br/>
  At this point, we form up in groups, discuss our answers, and come to consensus in our small groups as to what we think the answer should be.
1. Solutions + Q & A (10+ min) <br/>
  Finally, we go through the quiz as a large group, and compare answers.
1. IFTTT (30m) <br/>
  [If This Then That](http://ifttt.com) is a nifty online service that we'll be using this term. You should have already created an account; now, we'll do something with it.
1. Syllabus Overview (30 min) <br/>
  We'll go through the syllabus, focusing on the rationale behind the policies in the course. We will also be deciding some of those policies as a group.
1. Documenting the Build (20m) <br/>
  Throughout the term, you'll be working on projects that have physical build components. We'll be using a combination of the written word, still images, and video to document and report on your work. We'll spend the last part of the period documenting what you've done so far in the Plushie Monster build.
