# Week 6

## Monday

**Required Materials**: Laptop, Freeduino, Breadboard + Jumpers

* **Q & A**: If you have questions, we start there.
* **Quiz**: Then the quiz. Solo first, followed by pair.
* **Lab Intro**: The [LIFX Bulb](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/limemouse/lifx-the-light-bulb-reinvented).
* **Lab**: [Potentiometers and Multimeters]({{site.url}}/assignments/trimpots-and-multimeters.html)

**Before leaving**: You should be checked out by Matt. The lab says more.

## Tuesday

**Homework**: Practice solving the V=IR equation. 

1. You can [Download a PDF]({{site.url}}/downloads/20120924-ohms-law-practice.pdf) of the problem set.
1. You can also [view a pencast]({{site.url}}/downloads/20120924-ohms-law-pencast.pdf) (requires a current version of Acrobat Reader) that provides an example of how to use Ohm's Law to solve the problems in this practice problem set.

I want to take a minute to mention one or two things about *practice*. The [American Psychological Association has a few things to say](http://www.apa.org/education/k12/practice-acquisition.aspx) about the role of practice and learning. First, this quote:

> Deliberate practice consists of activities purposely designed to improve performance. These activities typically require effort and are not enjoyable. Most students are incapable of working on practice activities for long periods of time (Gobet & Campitelli, 2007, p. 160).

Gobet and Campitelli tell us two important things in this short quote:

1. Practice is supposed to help you improve.
1. Practice is only valuable in short bursts.

Further, there are 5 reasons given why practice is important:

> Practice is important for teaching and learning in at least five ways:
>
> 1. Practice greatly increases the likelihood that students will permanently remember new information that they encounter by transferring it into their knowledge base.
> 1. Practice increases student facility or automaticity (automaticity means learning to apply elements of knowledge automatically, without reflection). Automaticity is usually only achieved through extensive rehearsal and repetition. Automaticity frees up students' cognitive resources to handle more challenging tasks.
> 1. When students practice solving problems, it appears that they increase their ability to transfer practiced skills to new and more complex problems (Glover, Ronning, & Bruning, 1990).
> 1. Practice helps students acquire expertise in subject matter and therefore it helps to distinguish novices from experts in given subjects.
> 1. Cognitive gains from practice often bring about motivation for more learning (Kalchman, Moss, & Case, 2001).
> 
> Teachers should think of practice not as rote repetition, but as deliberate, goal-directed rehearsal paired with reflection on problem-solving processes.

You can [read more about practice online](http://www.apa.org/education/k12/practice-acquisition.aspx); you don't have to, but I wanted you to know that I have my reasons and motivations for practicing things.
