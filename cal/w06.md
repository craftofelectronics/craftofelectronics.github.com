# Week 6

## Monday

**Required Materials**: Laptop

We'll start with a brief review of voltage divider material. In particular:

1. Voltage dividers in context... why do we care about dividers?
1. Voltage dividers the easy way... on paper.
1. (Optional) Voltage dividers the easy way... a bit of Excel ninjaing.

Then, we'll update our VMs. Again. Along the way, I'll talk about how to care for your computer.

## Tuesday

Practice using the [tabular method for solving voltage divider problems in series circuits](http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_1/chpt_5/2.html), and [read about parallel circuits](http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_1/chpt_5/3.html). 

Come in Wednesday with questions.

## Wednesday

**Required Materials**: Laptop

1. We'll start with questions from the reading.
1. We'll continue (and hopefully finish) our lab.

## Thursday

Practice problems pertaining to series and parallel circuits. Review for practice exam.

## Friday

** Requires Materials**: You, pencil/pen.

Friday will be a practice exam. A pencast of the solutions will be provided (and linked in at the end of the day). You may discuss the exam with others, and you are **very strongly encouraged** to ask questions. My recommendation is the following:

1. Read the entire exam. Allow 10 minutes for this.
1. In your groups, discuss the kinds of problems that you see. Develop a list/outline of the kinds of problems that the practice exam contains.
1. Work on the problems in your small groups, discussing/asking questions as necessary.
