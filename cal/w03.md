# Week 4

We have three goals this week:

1. Complete our wiring plan and test our Freeduinos.
1. Learn about the oscilloscope, a fundamental tool in electronics.
1. Get started on our Contrast Houses.

## Monday

**Due before class**: [Distributed Electric Code Research]({{ site.url }}/assignments/distributed-electric-code-research.html)

**Materials Needed**: Laptop, Freeduino.

You should have completed your research regarding wiring in the Contrast House. First, we will break into groups to bring our work together, and then we will (as a class) create a single document that specifies the wiring for the entire Contrast House.

The remainder of our time will be spent finishing the Freeduino and testing that they work. 

## Tuesday

**Reading**: Please read pages 20-24 and 28-30 in the Mims. This reading covers a series of basic concepts:

* Parallel and serial circuits
* Pulses and noise
* Wire
* Resistors

**Viewing**: You need to watch the video playlist on [How to Use an Oscilloscope](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzY2abWCVTY). This video is 30 minutes long, but is clear and well done. I recommend it highly, and recommend you watch it before class on Wednesday.

## Wednesday

**Materials Needed**: Laptop, Freeduino.

1. Scope Overview / Discussion (20m)
3. Blinking and Fading (1h)
4. Writeup (30m)

Our first mini-lab (to be completed in class, ideally) will be on blinking and fading LEDs. This is, in part, a lab about getting used to our programming environment, [Flow](), as well as starting to use the Rigol 1102e oscilloscope.

## Thursday

**Reading**: Read pages 25-30 and 40-41 in the Mims. This covers a selection of additional electronic components that we will be working with in our Contrast Houses.

**Active Prep**: You read about these things on Tuesday, but we're going to review them Thursday and be ready for a quiz on Friday. In terms of "details," you'll want to refresh yourself on how to read resistors. There are some resources online you might use:

* [Color Code Challenge](http://people.sinclair.edu/nickreeder/Flash/colorCode.htm) <br/>
This page provides some quiz-type materials to help you learn the color codes.
* [Resistor Colour Code](http://www.funtrivia.com/trivia-quiz/SciTech/Resistor-Colour-Code-266472.html)><br/>
If you get past the British English (eg. "colour"), this quiz was really useful for testing whether I knew things well. I scored 733/1000 points. (Ten questions; they're timed.)

## Friday

**Materials Needed**: Laptop, Freeduino.

We'll begin with a quiz over the readings from this week. 

Then, we will begin the build on our Contrast Houses. If not... this section will change.

## Weekend
