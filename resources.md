# Pencasts

As I create pencasts to answer questions or introduce concepts, I'll link them in here (as well as in the calendar and/or assignment they are related to). The most recent pencast is always first.

  Voltage dividers occur whenever we have more than once resistor in a sequential circuit.

  V = IR. An intro.

# On The WWW

There are a lot of resources out there; we'll be leveraging them as we work through the course. You might consider using them as additional references while you are studying/wrestling with/learning any given topic.

* [Learning Electronics](http://www.learningelectronics.net/): a Creative Commons licensed text.
* [Learnabout Electronics](http://www.learnabout-electronics.org/) a (seemingly popular) site regarding electronics, broken down into categories. It has embedded quizzes to test your knowledge of basic concepts.
* [The Circuit Detective](http://www.thecircuitdetective.com/): Larry Dimock has put together an incredible set of resources on his website. We'll be referencing this as part of the course, and you may find it interesting reading before you have problems in your own living space... or when you're trying to fix things.
* [Hobbyist Circuits to Build DIY](http://www.brighthubengineering.com/diy-electronics-devices/124375-hobbyist-circuits-to-build-diy/): The peeps at Bright Hub Engineering have some good resources on their site, including introductory circuits like those we're going to build.
* [Electrical Wiring Diagram](http://www.mauenvios.com/trujillo2001/DIYH/DIY_my-own-house-electrical-wiring.htm): A long, somewhat rambling, but thorough treatment of all of the bits involved in wiring a house.
* [Circuit Lab]():
