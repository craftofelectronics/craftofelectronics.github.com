# Welcome

If you have never explored electricity and electronics before, and you enjoy making things, then this course was designed for you. We designed this course with three long-term goals in mind:

<br/>

1. **We want to be safe in everything we do**. <br/>
  People who do not respect electricity are dangerous to themselves and others. Safety is the most important thing you can learn in *Craft of Electronics*.
1. **We want to build things**. <br/>
  We will learn to think with our hands as we build electrical systems; if you can hold a pencil, you can build electronics.
1. **We want to design solutions to our own problems**. <br/>
  We study electricity and electronics because it enables us to better understand ourselves and our environment---and control that environment as well.

<br/>

Throughout the course, we will highlight when we are learning about <span class="label label-important">safety</span>, focusing on <span class="label label-success">building</span>, or <span class="label label-info">designing</span> circuits and systems.
