# It's Curtain Time

I think y'all can do some amazing things in the weeks remaining.

### The Last Week

It is possible that we will need Monday as a continuation of the previous week. If that is the case, the report will be due Friday.

* **Weekend** <br/>  **Prototype report**. Submit a 3+ page report detailing your prototype. Your report should have a short **Background**, where you explain your design idea. It should be followed by a section titled **Prototype Design**, where you describe your prototype, using circuit diagrams and photos as necessary.
* **Monday** <br/> KCAT, followed by work time.
* **Wednesday** <br/> Work time.
* **Friday** <br/> **Second Prototype Report**. Submit a 3+ page report Begin with a brief Introduction, where you recap your design and prototype. Then, a **Design Evolution** section, where you describe what next steps you believe are necessary to transform your prototype into a working, installed unit. Finally, you should include both your **Team Evaluation** and **Self Reflection**, which I will provide you with additional information about.

Your [final reports are due by or before the final exam slot](/assignments/final-report.html).

### Post-Turkey Break

* **Weekend** <br/> Turkey Weekend.
* **Monday** <br/> Class canceled.
* **Wednesday** <br/> **Regroup**. You want to accomplish three things this week:
  1. Lay out circuit diagram (neatly!) for a prototype control circuit.
  1. "Board" the circuit. This is a prototyping step, where you lay out everything 
  in an exploded form, so as to clearly document and test your design.
  1. Code the circuit. You should have software running on your board that demonstrates
  how the full circuit works.
* **Friday** <br/> Lecture: *What You've Learned, What Comes Next*, followed by work time.


### Prototype and Implement (Pre-Turkey Break)

The week of November 17th through November 23rd

* **Weekend** <br/> Read about relays.
* **Monday** <br/> Quiz. [Transistor lab II](assignments/the-h-bridge.html). When done, [upload to Moodle](http://moodle.berea.edu/mod/assignment/view.php?id=61672).
* **Wednesday** <br/> Break.
* **Friday** <br/> Break.

Over break, please produce a Fritzing diagram of your H-Bridge circuit, and include how it was connected up to your Arduino. There will be no class Monday after break, so you have until Wednesday of the week we're back to complete this. Submit both the circuit diagram from Fritzing as well as the code that was developed to Moodle.

### Design and Explore (Pre-Pre Turkey Break)

The week of November 10th through November 16th
 
* **Weekend** <br/> Revisit your brainstorming from Friday, and come prepared to share your ideas with others.
* **Monday** <br/> We will break into groups that divide across project components, so that we can share and design across whole-project components.  <br/> *Homework*: Shopping list submission. Reading re: brainstorming and creativity.
* **Wednesday**: <br/> Quiz. Presentation overview. Presentation layout and practice.  <br/>  *Homework*: Transistors.
* **Friday**: <br/> Presentations, quiz, transistor lab I.
