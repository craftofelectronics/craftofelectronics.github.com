<h3>Welcome!</h3>

Welcome to the *Craft of Electronics*. If you have never explored electricity and electronics before, and you enjoy making things, then this course was designed for you. We designed this course with three long-term goals in mind:

<br/>

1. **<span class="label label-important">We want to be safe in everything we do </span>**. Electricity is not dangerous... but people who do not respect electricity *are* dangerous. Safety is the most important thing you can learn in *Craft of Electronics*.
1. **<span class="label label-success">We want to build things</span>**. If you can hold a pencil, you can build a circuit. *Learning to think with our hands* is an important part of how we learn electronics.
1. **<span class="label label-info">We need to design solutions to problems </span>**. We will begin by building things other people have designed, and (over time) learn how to design new things ourselves.

Throughout the course, we will highlight when we are learning about <span class="label label-important">safety</span>, focusing on <span class="label label-success">building</span>, or <span class="label label-info">designing</span> circuits and systems.
