<h3>Welcome!</h3>

Welcome to the *Craft of Electronics*. If you have never explored electricity and electronics before, and you enjoy making things, then this course was designed for you. We designed this course with three long-term goals in mind:

<br/>

1. **{% loz red We want to be safe in everything we do %}**. Electricity is not dangerous... but people who do not respect electricity *are* dangerous. Safety is the most important thing you can learn in *Craft of Electronics*.
1. **{% loz green We want to build things %}**. If you can hold a pencil, you can build a circuit. *Learning to think with our hands* is an important part of how we learn electronics.
1. **{% loz blue We need to design solutions to problems %}**. We will begin by building things other people have designed, and (over time) learn how to design new things ourselves.

Throughout the course, we will highlight when we are learning about {% loz red safety %}, focusing on {% loz green building %}, or {% loz blue designing %} circuits and systems.
