# Welcome

If you have never explored electricity and electronics before, and you enjoy making things, then this course was designed for you. We designed this course with three long-term goals in mind:

1. **We want to be safe in everything we do**. <br/>
  People who do not respect electricity are dangerous to themselves and others. Safety is the most important thing you can learn in *Craft of Electronics*.
1. **We want to build things**. <br/>
  We will learn to think with our hands as we build electrical systems; if you can hold a pencil, you can build electronics.
1. **We want to design solutions to our own problems**. <br/>
  We study electricity and electronics because it enables us to better understand ourselves and our environment---and control that environment as well.
1. **We want to communicate our efforts with excellence.** <br/>
  We design, we build, and we **share**. That communication, be it via text, live presentation, or video, must be clearly articulated and professional in nature.


Throughout the course, we will highlight when we are learning about **safety**,
focusing on **building**, or **designing** circuits and systems.
