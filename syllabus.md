## Course Description

## Enduring Understandings

If this was the *only* course in electricity and electronics you take at Berea College, and you never touch or study the subject again while you are a student, what do we hope you will remember 10 years from now?

<br/>

1. **We want to be safe in everything we do**. <br/>
  People who do not respect electricity are dangerous to themselves and others. Safety is the most important thing you can learn in *Craft of Electronics*.
1. **We want to build things**. <br/>
  We will learn to think with our hands as we build electrical systems; if you can hold a pencil, you can build electronics.
1. **We want to design solutions to our own problems**. <br/>
  We study electricity and electronics because it enables us to better understand ourselves and our environment---and control that environment as well.

<br/>

It might be that you remember more; at the least, you must leave this course having learned that you can work with electrical systems safely, but it takes attention and care on your part.

## Learning Outcomes

## Materials Online

* We will use Moodle, provided by Berea College, for handing in assignments.
* We will use [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com/) for making sure we never lose our work.
* We will use [If This Then That (IFTTT)](http://ifttt.com/) to keep track of course announcements.

## Required Text

The following texts are *required*:

1. Forrest M. Mims III, [Getting Started in Electronics](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-Electronics-Forrest-Mims/dp/0945053282/ref=pd_sim_b_6)

### Further Reading

The following texts are *completely optional*. This means they will add to your experience in the course (if you read them), but I will not be assigning anything from them. Put another way: **you do not need to buy these books**. You might want to, though.

1. Black and Decker, [The Complete Guide to Wiring, 5th Edition.](http://www.amazon.com/Black-Decker-Complete-Guide-Wiring/dp/1589236017/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1344707680&sr=1-1&keywords=wiring)
1. Charles Platt, [Make: Electronics](http://www.amazon.com/Make-Electronics-Discovery-Charles-Platt/dp/0596153740/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_y)

## Required Convocations

As students, you are expected to attend 7 events from the [Berea Convocation Series](http://www.berea.edu/convocations/) per term. For this course, I am requiring that you attend **three** of these convocations.

* Dr. Lyle Roelofs: [Why Berea?](http://www.berea.edu/convocations/events/2012-2013/dr-lyle-roelofs.asp)
* A.A. Burleigh: [The Long Climb to Freedom](http://www.berea.edu/convocations/events/2012-2013/founders-day-convocation.asp)
* Dr. Lisa Dodson: [The Moral Underground: How Ordinary People Subvert an Unfair Economy](http://www.berea.edu/convocations/events/2012-2013/dr-lisa-dodson.asp)

I recommend [The California Guitar Trio](http://www.berea.edu/convocations/events/2012-2013/california-guitar-trio.asp), but do not require you attend it.
