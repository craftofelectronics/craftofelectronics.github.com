[This website](http://craftofelectronics.org/) is considered authoritative in all ways. This syllabus is subject to change; changes will be announced and/or discussed in class. You are responsible for being aware of these changes, and how they effect you.

## Course Description

Electrical Fundamentals is a study of the theory and techniques necessary for electrical and electronic systems and their associated equipment. Students will learn how to identify, calculate, measure, create, and repair basic electrical and electronic systems. These skills will be applied to a selection of practical projects that will challenge the students understanding of the material and problem solving/troubleshooting abilities. Topics may include AC/DC circuits, resistance, power, various components, and use of electrical measuring instruments. 
Practical Reasoning with Quantitative Emphasis (PRQ).

## In Plain Language

We will study how to safely work with electricity and digital electronics to do
study and control the world around us.

## Statement Regarding Disability

Students who have a disability that may prevent them from fully demonstrating
their abilities should contact Cindy Reed, MSW, LCSW, the Disability Services
Coordinator at (859) 985-3212, or by email at <a
href="mailto:cynthia_reed@berea.edu">cynthia_reed@berea.edu</a>, to discuss
accommodations necessary to ensure full participation in this course.  Upon
request, this syllabus can be made available in alternative forms.

## Course Prerequisites

Completion or waiver of MAT 012 or permission of instructor.


## Enduring Understandings

If this was the *only* course in electricity and electronics you take at Berea College, and you never touch or study the subject again while you are a student, what do we hope you will remember 10 years from now?

<br/>

1. **We want to be safe in everything we do**. <br/>
  People who do not respect electricity are dangerous to themselves and others. Safety is the most important thing you can learn in *Craft of Electronics*.
1. **We want to build things**. <br/>
  We will learn to think with our hands as we build electrical systems; if you can hold a pencil, you can build electronics.
1. **We want to design solutions to our own problems**. <br/>
  We study electricity and electronics because it enables us to better understand ourselves and our environment---and control that environment as well.

<br/>

It might be that you remember more; at the least, you must leave this course having learned that you can work with electrical systems safely, but it takes attention and care on your part.

## Course Objectives

* Demonstrate proper safety precautions related to equipment.
* Define voltage, resistance, current amperage, direct current, alternating current, and power supply.
* Identify electrical components and their associated values
* Interpret and create schematic diagrams of electrical circuits
* Explain the basic principles and operation of varied electrical/electronic components
* Implement Ohm's Law to calculate voltage, current, and resistance problems.
* *Create, calculate, and service simple series, parallel, and series-parallel circuits.*
* *Identify and explain the concepts of both DC and AC power systems and associated circuits.*
* *Calculate values for AC and DC resistive, inductive, and capacitive components.*
* Correctly utilize various measurement tools to identify and measure results of AC and DC laboratory exercises.

Italicised objectives may be expressed differently in the first offering of TAD 265.

## Materials Online

* We will use Moodle, provided by Berea College, for handing in assignments.
* We will use [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com/) for making sure we never lose our work.
* We will use [If This Then That (IFTTT)](http://ifttt.com/) to keep track of course announcements.

## Required Text and Materials

The following are *required*:

1. Forrest M. Mims III, [Getting Started in Electronics](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-Electronics-Forrest-Mims/dp/0945053282/ref=pd_sim_b_6)
1. **A Freeduino Kit**. Pick up a voucher at the bookstore. Surrender it to Matt for a kit.
1. A notebook.
1. Safety Goggles.

### Strongly Suggested

1. A calculator.

### Further Reading

The following texts are *completely optional*. This means they will add to your experience in the course (if you read them), but I will not be assigning anything from them. Put another way: **you do not need to buy these books**. You might want to, though.

1. Black and Decker, [The Complete Guide to Wiring, 5th Edition.](http://www.amazon.com/Black-Decker-Complete-Guide-Wiring/dp/1589236017/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1344707680&sr=1-1&keywords=wiring)
1. Charles Platt, [Make: Electronics](http://www.amazon.com/Make-Electronics-Discovery-Charles-Platt/dp/0596153740/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_y)

## Required Convocations

As students, you are expected to attend 7 events from the [Berea Convocation Series](http://www.berea.edu/convocations/) per term. For this course, I am requiring that you attend **three** of these convocations.

* Dr. Lyle Roelofs: [Why Berea?](http://www.berea.edu/convocations/events/2012-2013/dr-lyle-roelofs.asp)
* A.A. Burleigh: [The Long Climb to Freedom](http://www.berea.edu/convocations/events/2012-2013/founders-day-convocation.asp)
* Dr. Lisa Dodson: [The Moral Underground: How Ordinary People Subvert an Unfair Economy](http://www.berea.edu/convocations/events/2012-2013/dr-lisa-dodson.asp)

<!-- FIXME: Add link for Burleigh's Convo -->

I recommend [The California Guitar
Trio](http://www.berea.edu/convocations/events/2012-2013/california-guitar-trio.asp),
but do not require you attend it. I have also been told that A.A. Burleigh
(Berea grad) will be excellent.
 
## Grade Distribution

<table>
<tr> <td> Work </td> <td> 60% </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Midterms </td> <td> 12% each </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Final </td> <td> 16% </td> </tr>
</table>

"Work" means work done in-class, homeworks, laboratories, presentations, etc.
as assessed by the instructor, TAs, or (if appropriate) your peers. Put simply,
"more than half of your grade comes from doing excellent work throughout the
course."

*These values subject to change up to the end of September.*

## Attendance Policy

Because we are often working collaboratively, missing class often negatively
impacts others. **I reserve the right to subtract 5% from your final grade for
every missed class.**

Read that again. I'm not kidding.

If you have a recognized, documented excuse (medical center, etc.), or have
discussed the absence with me at least one week in advance (travel for
interviews, etc.), no penalty will be assesed.

For clarity: **you are expected to be in class**.
